# DoneJohn
A Solo Game dev project made in Unreal Engine 5.4.4

## Opening project
To open the source of this game project. Install unreal engine 5.4.4 and visual studio. (Higher unreal versions may work but could break stuff.) Clone the project, then right click the .uproject file and press more options, then generate the visual studio project files. Then you can either open the visual studio solution and run the local debugger as development editor. Or just open the unreal engine uproject file itself.
